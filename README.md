Artemis financial required us to check their software and address any vulnerabilities within it. As a financial institution software security is paramount. The main goal of the assignment was to create a self-signed certificate and use that to generate a secure checksum which was viewable on our browser.  

 

By integrated secure code throughout the application we were able to ensure the security of the project. Integrating secure code is vital to a company's well-being. Security ads not only peace of mind for our clients, but real protection against potential attacks. When handling customersâ€™ financial information it is of the upmost importance that our software is thoroughly secured.  

 

The most challenging part of the assignment was to initially get the vulnerability report to run properly. I genuinely have no idea what I did wrong initially or what I did to fix it as I tried numerous different things in the process. The other challenge was getting the self-signed certificate to work properly. I think the assignment as a whole was quite helpful since before this class I had no experience with these security features.  

 

The vulnerability report was useful for identifying issues with the imports we use and I think I would use that again mostly to see what needed to be updated. I do not think self-signed certificated would be that useful in the future, as they are not considered secure, but it was interesting to see how they functioned. The checksum verification could be useful to check data integrity, though I am not sure when exactly that would be required.  

 

By running an initial vulnerability report I was able to cross check that with a second report done after my code was integrated. This allowed me to see if any new vulnerabilities were added throughout the development process.  

 


This class highlighted the importance of software security practices in all facets of development. Going forward I will have much more focus and understanding when it comes to developing secure and standard software.  

 

The security report and assessment highlight my understanding of security threats, how to identify them, and what should be done to remedy them.
